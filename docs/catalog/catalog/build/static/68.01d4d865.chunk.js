webpackJsonp([68],{1020:function(e,s){e.exports='4.0.3 / 2017-12-05\n------------------\n\n- Fix wrong `chmod` values in `fs.remove()` [#501](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/501)\n- Fix `TypeError` on systems that don\'t have some `fs` operations like `lchown` [#520](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/520)\n\n4.0.2 / 2017-09-12\n------------------\n\n- Added `EOL` option to `writeJson*` & `outputJson*` (via upgrade to jsonfile v4)\n- Added promise support to [`fs.copyFile()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_copyfile_src_dest_flags_callback) in Node 8.5+\n- Added `.js` extension to `main` field in `package.json` for better tooling compatibility. [#485](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/485)\n\n4.0.1 / 2017-07-31\n------------------\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Previously, `ensureFile()` & `ensureFileSync()` would do nothing if the path was a directory. Now, they error out for consistency with `ensureDir()`. [#465](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/465), [#466](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/466), [#470](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/470)\n\n4.0.0 / 2017-07-14\n------------------\n\n### Changed\n\n- **BREAKING:** The promisified versions of `fs.read()` & `fs.write()` now return objects. See [the docs](docs/fs-read-write.md) for details. [#436](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/436), [#449](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/449)\n- `fs.move()` now errors out when destination is a subdirectory of source. [#458](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/458)\n- Applied upstream fixes from `rimraf` to `fs.remove()` & `fs.removeSync()`. [#459](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/459)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Got `fs.outputJSONSync()` working again; it was broken due to refactoring. [#428](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/428)\n\nAlso clarified the docs in a few places.\n\n3.0.1 / 2017-05-04\n------------------\n\n- Fix bug in `move()` & `moveSync()` when source and destination are the same, and source does not exist. [#415](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/415)\n\n3.0.0 / 2017-04-27\n------------------\n\n### Added\n\n- **BREAKING:** Added Promise support. All asynchronous native fs methods and fs-extra methods now return a promise if the callback is not passed. [#403](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/403)\n- `pathExists()`, a replacement for the deprecated `fs.exists`. `pathExists` has a normal error-first callback signature. Also added `pathExistsSync`, an alias to `fs.existsSync`, for completeness. [#406](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/406)\n\n### Removed\n\n- **BREAKING:** Removed support for setting the default spaces for `writeJson()`, `writeJsonSync()`, `outputJson()`, & `outputJsonSync()`. This was undocumented. [#402](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/402)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Upgraded jsonfile dependency to v3.0.0:\n  - **BREAKING:** Changed behavior of `throws` option for `readJsonSync()`; now does not throw filesystem errors when `throws` is `false`.\n- **BREAKING:** `writeJson()`, `writeJsonSync()`, `outputJson()`, & `outputJsonSync()` now output minified JSON by default for consistency with `JSON.stringify()`; set the `spaces` option to `2` to override this new behavior. [#402](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/402)\n- Use `Buffer.allocUnsafe()` instead of `new Buffer()` in environments that support it. [#394](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/394)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- `removeSync()` silently failed on Windows in some cases. Now throws an `EBUSY` error. [#408](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/408)\n\n2.1.2 / 2017-03-16\n------------------\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Weird windows bug that resulted in `ensureDir()`\'s callback being called twice in some cases. This bug may have also affected `remove()`. See [#392](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/392), [#393](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/393)\n\n2.1.1 / 2017-03-15\n------------------\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Reverted [`5597bd`](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/commit/5597bd5b67f7d060f5f5bf26e9635be48330f5d7), this broke compatibility with Node.js versions v4+ but less than `v4.5.0`.\n- Remove `Buffer.alloc()` usage in `moveSync()`.\n\n2.1.0 / 2017-03-15\n------------------\n\nThanks to [Mani Maghsoudlou (@manidlou)](https://github.com/manidlou) & [Jan Peer St\xf6cklmair (@JPeer264)](https://github.com/JPeer264) for their extraordinary help with this release!\n\n### Added\n- `moveSync()` See [#309], [#381](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/381). ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))\n- `copy()` and `copySync()`\'s `filter` option now gets the destination path passed as the second parameter. [#366](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/366) ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))\n\n### Changed\n- Use `Buffer.alloc()` instead of deprecated `new Buffer()` in `copySync()`. [#380](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/380) ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))\n- Refactored entire codebase to use ES6 features supported by Node.js v4+ [#355](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/355). [(@JPeer264)](https://github.com/JPeer264)\n- Refactored docs. ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))\n\n### Fixed\n\n- `move()` shouldn\'t error out when source and dest are the same. [#377](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/377), [#378](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/378) ([@jdalton](https://github.com/jdalton))\n\n2.0.0 / 2017-01-16\n------------------\n\n### Removed\n- **BREAKING:** Removed support for Node `v0.12`. The Node foundation stopped officially supporting it\non Jan 1st, 2017.\n- **BREAKING:** Remove `walk()` and `walkSync()`. `walkSync()` was only part of `fs-extra` for a little\nover two months. Use [klaw](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw) instead of `walk()`, in fact, `walk()` was just\nan alias to klaw. For `walkSync()` use [klaw-sync](https://github.com/mawni/node-klaw-sync). See: [#338], [#339]\n\n### Changed\n- **BREAKING:** Renamed `clobber` to `overwrite`. This affects `copy()`, `copySync()`, and `move()`. [#330], [#333]\n- Moved docs, to `docs/`. [#340]\n\n### Fixed\n- Apply filters to directories in `copySync()` like in `copy()`. [#324]\n- A specific condition when disk is under heavy use, `copy()` can fail. [#326]\n\n\n1.0.0 / 2016-11-01\n------------------\n\nAfter five years of development, we finally have reach the 1.0.0 milestone! Big thanks goes\nto [Ryan Zim](https://github.com/RyanZim) for leading the charge on this release!\n\n### Added\n- `walkSync()`\n\n### Changed\n- **BREAKING**: dropped Node v0.10 support.\n- disabled `rimaf` globbing, wasn\'t used. [#280]\n- deprecate `copy()/copySync()` option `filter` if it\'s a `RegExp`. `filter` should now be a function.\n- inline `rimraf`. This is temporary and was done because `rimraf` depended upon the beefy `glob` which `fs-extra` does not use. [#300]\n\n### Fixed\n- bug fix proper closing of file handle on `utimesMillis()` [#271]\n- proper escaping of files with dollar signs [#291]\n- `copySync()` failed if user didn\'t own file. [#199], [#301]\n\n\n0.30.0 / 2016-04-28\n-------------------\n- Brought back Node v0.10 support. I didn\'t realize there was still demand. Official support will end **2016-10-01**.\n\n0.29.0 / 2016-04-27\n-------------------\n- **BREAKING**: removed support for Node v0.10. If you still want to use Node v0.10, everything should work except for `ensureLink()/ensureSymlink()`. Node v0.12 is still supported but will be dropped in the near future as well.\n\n0.28.0 / 2016-04-17\n-------------------\n- **BREAKING**: removed `createOutputStream()`. Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-output-stream. See: [#192][#192]\n- `mkdirs()/mkdirsSync()` check for invalid win32 path chars. See: [#209][#209], [#237][#237]\n- `mkdirs()/mkdirsSync()` if drive not mounted, error. See: [#93][#93]\n\n0.27.0 / 2016-04-15\n-------------------\n- add `dereference` option to `copySync()`. [#235][#235]\n\n0.26.7 / 2016-03-16\n-------------------\n- fixed `copy()` if source and dest are the same. [#230][#230]\n\n0.26.6 / 2016-03-15\n-------------------\n- fixed if `emptyDir()` does not have a callback: [#229][#229]\n\n0.26.5 / 2016-01-27\n-------------------\n- `copy()` with two arguments (w/o callback) was broken. See: [#215][#215]\n\n0.26.4 / 2016-01-05\n-------------------\n- `copySync()` made `preserveTimestamps` default consistent with `copy()` which is `false`. See: [#208][#208]\n\n0.26.3 / 2015-12-17\n-------------------\n- fixed `copy()` hangup in copying blockDevice / characterDevice / `/dev/null`. See: [#193][#193]\n\n0.26.2 / 2015-11-02\n-------------------\n- fixed `outputJson{Sync}()` spacing adherence to `fs.spaces`\n\n0.26.1 / 2015-11-02\n-------------------\n- fixed `copySync()` when `clogger=true` and the destination is read only. See: [#190][#190]\n\n0.26.0 / 2015-10-25\n-------------------\n- extracted the `walk()` function into its own module [`klaw`](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw).\n\n0.25.0 / 2015-10-24\n-------------------\n- now has a file walker `walk()`\n\n0.24.0 / 2015-08-28\n-------------------\n- removed alias `delete()` and `deleteSync()`. See: [#171][#171]\n\n0.23.1 / 2015-08-07\n-------------------\n- Better handling of errors for `move()` when moving across devices. [#170][#170]\n- `ensureSymlink()` and `ensureLink()` should not throw errors if link exists. [#169][#169]\n\n0.23.0 / 2015-08-06\n-------------------\n- added `ensureLink{Sync}()` and `ensureSymlink{Sync}()`. See: [#165][#165]\n\n0.22.1 / 2015-07-09\n-------------------\n- Prevent calling `hasMillisResSync()` on module load. See: [#149][#149].\nFixes regression that was introduced in `0.21.0`.\n\n0.22.0 / 2015-07-09\n-------------------\n- preserve permissions / ownership in `copy()`. See: [#54][#54]\n\n0.21.0 / 2015-07-04\n-------------------\n- add option to preserve timestamps in `copy()` and `copySync()`. See: [#141][#141]\n- updated `graceful-fs@3.x` to `4.x`. This brings in features from `amazing-graceful-fs` (much cleaner code / less hacks)\n\n0.20.1 / 2015-06-23\n-------------------\n- fixed regression caused by latest jsonfile update: See: https://github.com/jprichardson/node-jsonfile/issues/26\n\n0.20.0 / 2015-06-19\n-------------------\n- removed `jsonfile` aliases with `File` in the name, they weren\'t documented and probably weren\'t in use e.g.\nthis package had both `fs.readJsonFile` and `fs.readJson` that were aliases to each other, now use `fs.readJson`.\n- preliminary walker created. Intentionally not documented. If you use it, it will almost certainly change and break your code.\n- started moving tests inline\n- upgraded to `jsonfile@2.1.0`, can now pass JSON revivers/replacers to `readJson()`, `writeJson()`, `outputJson()`\n\n0.19.0 / 2015-06-08\n-------------------\n- `fs.copy()` had support for Node v0.8, dropped support\n\n0.18.4 / 2015-05-22\n-------------------\n- fixed license field according to this: [#136][#136] and https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.10.0\n\n0.18.3 / 2015-05-08\n-------------------\n- bugfix: handle `EEXIST` when clobbering on some Linux systems. [#134][#134]\n\n0.18.2 / 2015-04-17\n-------------------\n- bugfix: allow `F_OK` ([#120][#120])\n\n0.18.1 / 2015-04-15\n-------------------\n- improved windows support for `move()` a bit. https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/commit/92838980f25dc2ee4ec46b43ee14d3c4a1d30c1b\n- fixed a lot of tests for Windows (appveyor)\n\n0.18.0 / 2015-03-31\n-------------------\n- added `emptyDir()` and `emptyDirSync()`\n\n0.17.0 / 2015-03-28\n-------------------\n- `copySync` added `clobber` option (before always would clobber, now if `clobber` is `false` it throws an error if the destination exists).\n**Only works with files at the moment.**\n- `createOutputStream()` added. See: [#118][#118]\n\n0.16.5 / 2015-03-08\n-------------------\n- fixed `fs.move` when `clobber` is `true` and destination is a directory, it should clobber. [#114][#114]\n\n0.16.4 / 2015-03-01\n-------------------\n- `fs.mkdirs` fix infinite loop on Windows. See: See https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/pull/74 and https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/issues/66\n\n0.16.3 / 2015-01-28\n-------------------\n- reverted https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/commit/1ee77c8a805eba5b99382a2591ff99667847c9c9\n\n\n0.16.2 / 2015-01-28\n-------------------\n- fixed `fs.copy` for Node v0.8 (support is temporary and will be removed in the near future)\n\n0.16.1 / 2015-01-28\n-------------------\n- if `setImmediate` is not available, fall back to `process.nextTick`\n\n0.16.0 / 2015-01-28\n-------------------\n- bugfix `fs.move()` into itself. Closes [#104]\n- bugfix `fs.move()` moving directory across device. Closes [#108]\n- added coveralls support\n- bugfix: nasty multiple callback `fs.copy()` bug. Closes [#98]\n- misc fs.copy code cleanups\n\n0.15.0 / 2015-01-21\n-------------------\n- dropped `ncp`, imported code in\n- because of previous, now supports `io.js`\n- `graceful-fs` is now a dependency\n\n0.14.0 / 2015-01-05\n-------------------\n- changed `copy`/`copySync` from `fs.copy(src, dest, [filters], callback)` to `fs.copy(src, dest, [options], callback)` [#100][#100]\n- removed mockfs tests for mkdirp (this may be temporary, but was getting in the way of other tests)\n\n0.13.0 / 2014-12-10\n-------------------\n- removed `touch` and `touchSync` methods (they didn\'t handle permissions like UNIX touch)\n- updated `"ncp": "^0.6.0"` to `"ncp": "^1.0.1"`\n- imported `mkdirp` => `minimist` and `mkdirp` are no longer dependences, should now appease people who wanted `mkdirp` to be `--use_strict` safe. See [#59]([#59][#59])\n\n0.12.0 / 2014-09-22\n-------------------\n- copy symlinks in `copySync()` [#85][#85]\n\n0.11.1 / 2014-09-02\n-------------------\n- bugfix `copySync()` preserve file permissions [#80][#80]\n\n0.11.0 / 2014-08-11\n-------------------\n- upgraded `"ncp": "^0.5.1"` to `"ncp": "^0.6.0"`\n- upgrade `jsonfile": "^1.2.0"` to `jsonfile": "^2.0.0"` => on write, json files now have `\\n` at end. Also adds `options.throws` to `readJsonSync()`\nsee https://github.com/jprichardson/node-jsonfile#readfilesyncfilename-options for more details.\n\n0.10.0 / 2014-06-29\n------------------\n* bugfix: upgaded `"jsonfile": "~1.1.0"` to `"jsonfile": "^1.2.0"`, bumped minor because of `jsonfile` dep change\nfrom `~` to `^`. [#67]\n\n0.9.1 / 2014-05-22\n------------------\n* removed Node.js `0.8.x` support, `0.9.0` was published moments ago and should have been done there\n\n0.9.0 / 2014-05-22\n------------------\n* upgraded `ncp` from `~0.4.2` to `^0.5.1`, [#58]\n* upgraded `rimraf` from `~2.2.6` to `^2.2.8`\n* upgraded `mkdirp` from `0.3.x` to `^0.5.0`\n* added methods `ensureFile()`, `ensureFileSync()`\n* added methods `ensureDir()`, `ensureDirSync()` [#31]\n* added `move()` method.

(Srirangan / [#36])\n\n0.7.1 / 2013-10-12\n------------------\n* `copySync()` implemented (Srirangan / [#33])\n* updated to the latest `jsonfile` version `1.1.0` which gives `options` params for the JSON methods. Closes [#32]\n\n0.7.0 / 2013-10-07\n------------------\n* update readme conventions\n* `copy()` now works if destination directory does not exist. Closes [#29]\n\n0.6.4 / 2013-09-05\n------------------\n* changed `homepage` field in package.json to remove NPM warning\n\n0.6.3 / 2013-06-28\n------------------\n* changed JSON spacing default from `4` to `2` to follow Node conventions\n* updated `jsonfile` dep\n* updated `rimraf` dep\n\n0.6.2 / 2013-06-28\n------------------\n* added .npmignore, [#25]\n\n0.6.1 / 2013-05-14\n------------------\n* modified for `strict` mode, closes [#24]\n* added `outputJson()/outputJsonSync()`, closes [#23]\n\n0.6.0 / 2013-03-18\n------------------\n* removed node 0.6 support\n* added node 0.10 support\n* upgraded to latest `ncp` and `rimraf`.\n* optional `graceful-fs` support.
